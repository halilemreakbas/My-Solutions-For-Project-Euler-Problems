## ðŸ“š **About Project Euler**
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging mathematical and programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Itâ€™s a great way to practice problem-solving and coding skills.

---

## ðŸš€ **Repository Structure**
Each problem has its own file in the `solutions/` folder. The files are named as `problem_X.py`, where `X` is the problem number.
